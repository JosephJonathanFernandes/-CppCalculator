# 🧮 C++ CLI Calculator

A simple yet powerful **command-line calculator** written in C++ that supports:

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Modulus: `%` (integer only)
- Exponentiation: `^`
- History tracking of up to 100 calculations
- Reuse of previous result using `ans`
- Persistent history saved to a text file

---

## 📦 Features

- Perform calculations with two numbers and an operator
- Use `ans` to reference the result of the last calculation
- View past calculations at any time
- Saves calculation history to `calc_history.txt` automatically
- Input validation to handle bad data and divide-by-zero
